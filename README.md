# The Gallows - Dead Mans Curse

A Windows Console hangman like game, written in C++ version 17 with the MingW compiler.

In this new  version you can change the color display from the Monochrom Green to that of
Amber or Macintosh Gray. With only pushing the F5 and F6 keys. You are also as liberty to
either type the letter or use the mouse to select what letter you wish to guess. You can
once the screen is filled with options be able to move from different screens to search a
vast array of "WordLists". It's even easier then ever in customizing the words you wish
to have inputed into the game.
